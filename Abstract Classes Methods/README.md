# Abstract Classes & Methods in Java
In class, we discussed the idea of **abstract** classes and methods. In this exercise, you'll get some practice with writing an `abstract` class and method of your own.

## Task

Write an abstract class named `Shape`. It has one attribute, the `color` of the shape. It also has one method, an `abstract` method for calculating the area, call it `getArea`.

Write a class named `Trapeziod` that inherits from this `Shape` class. The formula to calculate the area of a `Trapeziod` is

where `a` and `b` are the parallel bases of the `Trapeziod` and `h` is the height. Make sure that your `Trapeziod` class has the necessary attributes.


## Deliverable

Commit whatever you have to this repository by the end of class time.

This commit will help determine your base grade. Additions may be committed to the repo between that time and the time we go over it in class for additional points. However, to recevie _any_ credit, the first commit must be made before class is over, unless otherwise specified.
