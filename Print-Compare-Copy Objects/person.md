# Instructions from `Person` class exercise
***You only need this if you have not done the previous activity or need to make changes to your `Person` class, otherwise, please return to the main repository by clicking the `<>Code` button in the navigation bar.***

This exercise is to give you even more practice with writing a class in java. As mentioned in class, we'll be making our classes more and more complex, so writing a class should be the simple part since we're going to add so much more to them as the semester goes on. Please note: The next few exercises will be based on this exercise, so you'll not want to skip it!

## Task

Write a `Person` class with attributes for the person's name, age, gender, and phone number.

Also include:

- getters and setters for each attribute
- a constructor with parameters for each of the attributes
- a constructor with parameters for setting the person name and gender only

For practice and to make sure everything works, create a Driver class with at least 2 intances of the class. Get and set some of the attributes to see how everything is working.

## Deliverable

Commit whatever you have to this repository by the end of class time.
This commit will help determine your base grade. Additions may be committed to the repo between that time and the time we go over it in class for additional points. However, to recevie _any_ credit, the first commit must be made before class is over, unless otherwise specified.
