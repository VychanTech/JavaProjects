# Printing, Comparing, and Copying Objects

In this exercise, you'll practice what we just discussed by adding `toString` and `equals` methods and a copy constructor to your `Person` class from the previous exercise. Before beginning the task below, make sure you make any necessary corrections to your `Person` class based on the feedback received. If you have not completed that exercise, click [here](person.md) for the details.

## Task

1. Add a `toString` method to your `Person` class. What to display will be up to you, but it should be some combination of at least 2 of the attributes in the `Person` class. Compile your `Person` class at this point. Then, test this out in your driver by printing one of your `Person` objects.

2. Add an `equals` method to your `Person` class. Two `Person` objects are the same of all of their attributes are equal. That is, if they have the same name, age, gender, and phone number. Compile your `Person` class at this point. Then, test this out in your driver as well.

3. Add a copy constructor to your `Person` class. It should set all the attributes of the new `Person` object. Compile your `Person` class. Then, in your driver, create an additional object using this copy constructor and print it to test this constructor is working properly.

## Deliverable

Commit whatever you have to this repository by the end of class time.
This commit will help determine your base grade. Additions may be committed to the repo between that time and the time we go over it in class for additional points. However, to receive _any_ credit, the first commit must be made before class is over, unless otherwise specified.
